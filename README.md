# AIS3-Project

This project is a small task to be completed within a five-day deadline for AIS3. 
Our goal is to create a Linebot that, when users input a URL or IP address, can return whether this address has been listed as a malicious IP. 
We will be using APIs from AbuseIPDB, IPdata, and VirusTotal.
